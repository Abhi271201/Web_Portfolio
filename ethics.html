      <h2>‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Dilemma Response</h2>
      <p>
        One of the ethical dilemmas I encountered involved the high-pressure release of a software module for HVAC systems. During testing, we found a minor but critical bug that could delay temperature regulation. Despite pressure from a project manager to proceed with a temporary fix to meet a contractual milestone, I made the decision to delay the release and push for a permanent solution. My approach was based on a framework of stakeholder safety, long-term credibility, and team values. I led a risk assessment, ensured team collaboration, and provided transparent communication to the client. Although we missed the original deadline, the client appreciated our honesty and continued to work with us.

      <h2>üåé Cultural Adaptation Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Coming from a structured, hierarchical Indian engineering culture, I recognize the differences in U.S. workplace dynamics. In India, leadership tends to be top-down and formal, while U.S. engineering workplaces emphasize openness, flat hierarchies, and active individual participation.
      </p>
      <p>
        To adapt, I plan to adopt tools like Gantt charts and Trello to foster transparent task management, implement regular sync-up meetings, and use anonymous feedback tools to support a feedback-rich, team-aligned environment. I aim to lead with empathy, be open to direct feedback, and promote participative discussions.
