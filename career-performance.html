                This reflection encompasses several key real-life leadership theories and practices. The case of Toyota
                illustrates the systems-based approach to decision-making, as the
                company halted production to train its employees in craftsmanship skills that would improve
                its long-term quality of defects (Hino, 2024). This aligns with leadership practices that
                prioritize sustainable value over short-term performance.

                Similarly, feedback systems were designed to enhance communication, clarify roles, and foster inclusion
                within engineering work environments.

                This template will provide structured, actionable feedback that delivers priorities in
                line with the team and business. In contrast to generic assessments, it combines the concepts
                2
                of performance and potential, enabling reviewers to evaluate not only the engineer's ability to
                deliver but also their strategic thinking and level of collaboration. It fosters systems
                awareness, as it features problem-solving as one of its primary measures, and engineers are
                encouraged not to view separate activities in isolation (Pathirana, 2024).
